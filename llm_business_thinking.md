# How an LLM Should Extract Business Insights

## The Thinking Flow an LLM Should Follow:

### 1. UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
```python
# First, understand what kind of business this is
questions_to_ask = [
    "What industry are we in?",
    "What are our main revenue drivers?",
    "Who are our customers?",
    "What is our business model?"
]
```

### 2. IDENTIFY KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS
Instead of "run statistical tests", think:
```python
business_questions = {
    "revenue": [
        "What drives our revenue growth?",
        "Which customers generate most revenue?",
        "What products are most profitable?",
        "Is our marketing spend effective?"
    ],
    "customers": [
        "Who are our best customers?",
        "Which customers are at risk of churning?",
        "What customer segments exist?",
        "How does customer size affect lifetime value?"
    ],
    "products": [
        "Which products have highest margins?",
        "How does quality affect satisfaction?",
        "What drives product returns?",
        "Which categories perform best?"
    ],
    "operations": [
        "Are there seasonal patterns?",
        "What days/months are strongest?",
        "How efficient is our discounting?"
        "Where are the anomalies/issues?"
    ]
}
```

### 3. TOOLS THE LLM NEEDS

#### A. SQL Query Builder
```python
def analyze_business_question(question: str) -> str:
    """Convert business question to SQL query."""

    if "best customers" in question:
        return """
        SELECT
            c.company_name,
            c.company_size,
            COUNT(t.transaction_id) as total_purchases,
            SUM(t.net_amount) as total_revenue,
            c.lifetime_value,
            c.churn_risk
        FROM customer_profiles c
        JOIN sales_transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
        GROUP BY c.customer_id
        ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
        LIMIT 20
        """
```

#### B. Narrative Generator
```python
def generate_business_narrative(data: pd.DataFrame, context: str) -> str:
    """Convert data findings into business story."""

    # Not "41 anomalies detected in lifetime_value"
    # But: "Your top 20% of enterprise customers generate 65% of revenue,
    #       but 3 of your top 10 accounts show high churn risk signals"
```

#### C. Actionable Recommendation Engine
```python
def generate_recommendations(insights: list) -> list:
    """Convert insights into specific actions."""

    # Not: "Investigate unusual patterns"
    # But: "Schedule retention meetings with Company_45, Company_89,
    #       and Company_123 - they show 70%+ churn risk despite
    #       $500K+ lifetime value"
```

### 4. THE ACTUAL THINKING FLOW

```python
class BusinessAnalystLLM:

    def analyze_business(self, datasets: dict) -> dict:

        # Step 1: Profile the business
        business_profile = self.understand_business_model(datasets)

        # Step 2: Calculate key metrics
        metrics = {
            "revenue_growth": self.calculate_revenue_trend(),
            "customer_concentration": self.calculate_customer_concentration(),
            "product_performance": self.rank_products_by_profitability(),
            "marketing_roi": self.calculate_marketing_effectiveness()
        }

        # Step 3: Find specific insights
        insights = []

        # Customer insights
        insights.append(self.find_at_risk_valuable_customers())
        insights.append(self.identify_growth_segments())

        # Product insights
        insights.append(self.find_underperforming_products())
        insights.append(self.identify_cross_sell_opportunities())

        # Revenue insights
        insights.append(self.analyze_pricing_effectiveness())
        insights.append(self.evaluate_discount_strategy())

        # Step 4: Generate narrative
        story = self.tell_business_story(metrics, insights)

        # Step 5: Create action plan
        actions = self.prioritize_actions(insights)

        return {
            "executive_summary": story,
            "key_metrics": metrics,
            "insights": insights,
            "recommended_actions": actions
        }
```

### 5. EXAMPLE OUTPUT DIFFERENCE

#### Current Output (Statistical):
```
✓ 41 anomalies in lifetime_value
✓ Variance decomposition for net_amount
[SKIP] Test segmentation_analysis not yet implemented
```

#### Business-Focused Output:
```
KEY FINDING: Revenue Concentration Risk
• Your top 10 customers (2% of base) generate 35% of revenue
• 3 of these top customers show high churn risk:
  - GlobalTech Corp: $780K LTV, 85% churn risk
  - MegaRetail Inc: $650K LTV, 72% churn risk
  - DataSystems Ltd: $590K LTV, 68% churn risk

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
→ Schedule executive retention meetings this week
→ Potential revenue at risk: $2.02M (18% of annual)

OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED: Untapped Enterprise Segment
• 47 mid-size companies show similar profile to your best customers
• Currently averaging $50K annual vs $200K for similar profiles
• Estimated revenue opportunity: $7.05M

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
→ Launch targeted enterprise upgrade campaign
→ Focus on Technology and Healthcare sectors
```

## The Core Issue:

Your system has the data and relationships but is thinking like a **data scientist** instead of a **business analyst**.

The LLM needs to:
1. Ask business questions first
2. Use statistics to answer those questions
3. Generate narratives, not test results
4. Provide specific, actionable recommendations
5. Quantify impact in business terms ($, %, customer names)

Would you like me to implement this business-focused approach to replace the current statistical test-heavy system?
